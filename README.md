# People Couter App
This works just as an normal tally couter device expects it's an software and just on a click of a button you can count the number of people entered in your restaurant.
Although initially this was built with an idea of just counting people but it can be used to count or keep track of anything as because it also has an save feature and it also shows the history of previously saved data.
